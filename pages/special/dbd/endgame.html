            <p>- Camp hook</p>
            <p>- Proxy camp</p>
            <p>- Tunnel</p>
            <p>- Slug</p>
            <p>- Abusing perk</p>
            <p>- Meta build</p>
            <p>- Killer meta or toxic</p>
            <p>and so on.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div>
            <p><b>I don't care.</b></p>

            <p>I don't give a damn fuck whether I've done any of these things or not.<br>
            Between false accusations and those who are never happy, it's hard to have relevant discussions with players.</p>

            <p>If I've (<i>really</i>) used one of this ‘actions’, it's to gain a certain advantage during the game that I need to win, a notion that many of you have great difficulty understanding that the killer also wants to win the game.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, if these ‘actions’ are present in the game, it's to use them, especially those that have been present since the beginning of the game. If some don't use them, no problem, but don't reproach a player for using a game's features as long as they don't use them to cause malicious actions apart from winning the game.<br>
            If you're unhappy with a mechanic, go complain to the <b>DEVELOPERS</b> - I'm not responsible for the content of the game.</p>

            <p>If, despite all that, you still want me dead or you're personally furious at me for playing a video game, then just fuck off.<br>
            And touch some grass, it'll make you feel better.</p>

            <p>You don't know me, and I don't know you, just move on to the next game, or take a break if you're about to explode.<br>
            I understand this feeling, but that's no excuse for acting like a jerk.</p>

            <p>Thank you and have a nice day.</p>
